#   Implementation Proposal


##  Abstract
It is important to analyze a problem and make a decision before writing code.
Obviously.

So, a Command Line Interface (CLI) application must solve the following problems:
  - parsing CLI arguments, passed by a user;
  - providing usage information, by printouts;
  - provide results, by printouts or files.

This document describes possible approaches for solving problems listed above.


##  Introduction
One of the commonly used ways of interaction with computers is a CLI.
Mainly, it works as follows:

1.  User opens a terminal.
1.  User issues a command.
1.  The command prints results.


## CLI Arguments
The best practice to parse arguments properly is to follow particular standards.
The standard for CLI is [POSIX.1-2008](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html).


## Usage
